The following sections describe the relevant physics processes of the analysis.

## Signal process

The physical process of interest, also often called signal, is the production of the Higgs boson. The main production modes of the Higgs boson are the gluon fusion and the vector boson fusion production indicated in the plots with the labels gg→H and qq→H, respectively. See below the two Feynman diagrams that describe the processes at leading order.

## Background processes

Besides the Higgs boson, many other processes can produce very similar signatures in the detector, which have to be taken into account to draw any conclusions from the data.
